Music_Player is a program that takes a folder with MP3 music files and allows you to plays them.

Features such as randomize, pause/play, skipping forward/back 5 seconds, and skipping songs all exist through clicks and key presses.

Player_001 is a simple version of the music playing program that does not handle subfolders. It can skip songs sometimes if using the arrows to navigate.
Player_001 is navigated as such: "R" to randomize, "Space" to pause/play, Up and Down arrows to go to the next/previous song, Left and Right arrows to skip forward/back 5 seconds.

Player_002 can handle subfolders. It is now operated using the WASD keys.
Player_002 is navigated as such: "R" to randomize, "Space" to pause/play, "W"/"S" to go to the next/previous song, "A"/"D" arrows to skip forward/back 5 seconds.
Player_002 also can handle the file tree as such: "Up"/"Down" to move up and down songs, "Left"/"Right" arrows to collapse/expand folders.
In Player_002 moving up and down songs using "W" and "S" will not go past the folder that of whose song is currently playing. Depending on the current collapse/expansion of folders, using the arrow keys may result in skipping folders. Using left and right arrow keys when playing a song will reset the song back to the beginning in most cases.

Player_003 will be focused on better graphics. No new functionality was added. If any problems arise, please let me know.
If you have any "It doesn't works on my machine problems, I will not be able to fix them. Please find a solution yourself."
